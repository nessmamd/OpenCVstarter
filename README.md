Movementfrompoint.py
I chose a randm x,y point on the screen and it detects the distance from a moving object. Since the point is a value you can change it later on.
PLEASE make sure your camera isnt moving or there isnt any rapid movement around you as it will detect it.

Twopoint.py
the user has to click on the screen for where they want to measure from. 
Uses the right click and the left click of the mouse to assign.
If you have a mac you cant use the trackpad you have to use an external mouse.
